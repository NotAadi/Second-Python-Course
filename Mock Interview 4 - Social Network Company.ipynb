This makes it so that, if you XOR something 2 times (meaning that it is duplicated in the list), the output will be 0 - however, if you only XOR once, you will get an output of that thing - this makes it so that all the things repeated will not affect the outcome - only the thing that is there an odd number of times will be shown.
