    "These problems require you to have weird prior knowledge about python. These are the worst types of riddles.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Estimation Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "Estimation problems rely on you to do some basic math and computation to find the answer to a seemingly random question, like \"how many happy birthday posts are there on facebook every day\". To solve this, you would first estimate the number of users on facebook, then divide by 365 and then maybe multiply by 2 or 3 because of the number of people saying happy birthday to any given person. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Math Puzzles\n",
    "\n",
    "These ones have roots in math and computer science, and will be the ones most commonly asked in an interview setting. They will require algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to approach the problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't panic when you are asked a brain teaser: the interviewer will want to see how you tackle the problem. They won't expect you to immediately know the answer. You should start talking and show the interviewer how you usually approach a problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In many cases, brain teasers will have connection back to fundamental laws of computer science. If you get stuck, try and simplify the problem. Solve it for a small number of items or a special case and see if you can generalize it.\n",

IF one side was heavier, take that side, take 1 of the coins and put it aside and weight the remaining two coins against each other. If one is heavier, that one is the odd one out.

You continue toggling every nth locker on pass number n. After your hundredth pass of the hallway, in which you toggle only locker number 100, how many lockers are open?"

    "### Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "You know that a locker can only be open if it was toggled an odd number of times: they all started open, so they will only be open if toggled an odd number of times. We can deduce that for each pass through the lockers, you will open every locker that is a factor of the pass number and 100: for example, if you were doing pass 5, you would only toggle 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 etc etc. Therefore, a locker _n_ would only be open if it had an odd number of factors, and the only numbers with an odd number of factors are __Perfect Squares__. This is becuase, instead of having a \"factor rainbow\" of pairs of factors, they also have an extra factor, which is the square root: after all, you cant put factors of 9 as 1,3,3,9, but instead as 1,3,9. Therefore, only the perfect squares will be open: the perfect squares up to 100 are 1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81, and 100, so only 10 lockers will be open"

Once the first rope is fully burned, start burning the second end of the second rope. Basically, it will take 30 minutes for the first rope to fully burn, and the second rope will only have 30 minutes left with one end burning. Then, if you burn the other side, it will become only 15 minutes left. When the second roep is done burning, it will have been 45 minutes"
