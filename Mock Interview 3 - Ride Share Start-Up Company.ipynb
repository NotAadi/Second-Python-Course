    "In one step, without using any space, you could use a binary search to find if any given item is in the list in O(log(n)) time. This is faster than using a sequential search (going through every item in the list, one at a time), which is in O(n) time. A binary search works like this - it takes the middle value of a sorted list, and if that value is greater than the amount we are looking for, then we know that we will have to search the first half; this same thing happens when the value is lesser, except we look at the larger half. We then take the middle value of that new section we will look at, and continue the process until we find the item. This is in log(n) time because of how the search works - it splits the items we are looking at in half every time. Because of this, if you double the size of the list, you will only have to do one more separation - that is the definition of log(n). It also works in constant space, as you are looking at a constant number of variables at a given time."
